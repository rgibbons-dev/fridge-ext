# fridge-ext

firefox extension to receive URLs from any device on your LAN, or whoever and wherever you choose to expose the server to.

in my case, i wanted to open youtube videos sent to my phone on my linux desktop. i use a Shortcut to make an HTTP request to post my URL to the server, which the extension will fetch on open. it persists links until manual deletion.

fridge is what your refrigerator may be now, a place to pin things you collect day by day.
